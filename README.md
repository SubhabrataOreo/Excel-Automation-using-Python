# Excel-Automation-using-Python
Automated MS-Excel Pivot Table and Charts making using Python in Jupyter notebook

Primarily started with a single excel file.
Loaded that in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
Created Pivot table with 3 important columns and all the entries.
Exported that pivot table in a new Excel file in the same directory.
Again loaded that newly created excel file and used the pivot table to create an Excel Bar chart.
Finally saved the excel file in working directory.

Started to automate the things with a simple python function.
made a list of all the excel files present in the working directory.
Created a function with the list as the only argument.
The function does the same even for multiple excel files present in the working directory.
